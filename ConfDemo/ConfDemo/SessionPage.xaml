Access to prior work and crowd-based contributions allow companies to innovate faster and a greater number of producers to foster a broader and more diverse ecosystem.",
      "description": "We also can (re)shape the artifacts we use and in this way shape our own experiences. What are the mechanisms by which this happens in practice – in our lives and in our work? What began a couple of decades ago as the open source movement is now extending into open source hardware, open product development, and open enterprise. How will these collaborative trends lead to a more efficient, satisfying and meaningful system of production? Do we have the courage to take the opportunity to disrupt manufacturing, stabilize economies, restore ecology, unleash productivity everywhere and leapfrog through old problems while leaving nobody behind?",

We complete the introduction with an overview of the most important services available, such as the selection or preference services. All topics include hands-on examples that we’ll work through together. Finally, we demonstrate how innovations from Eclipse 4 can be integrated into existing applications based on Eclipse 3.x and introduce possible migration paths.\r\nThis session is a revised submission of the EclipseCon North America tutorial, which received excellent feedback and was well attended.
